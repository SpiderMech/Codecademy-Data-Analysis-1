# Codecademy-Data-Analysis-1
This repo includes a python script, a jupyter notebook (.ipynb file), and a csv file

*********Introduction*********

This is a jupyter data analysis project on US medical insurance costs
Click into the codecademy-umicda.ipynb file to see what its about<br>

Here's a short summary:<br>
US medical insurance costs are notoriously high, there are several factors that may contribute to this:<br>
age, sex, BMI Score, number of children, and whether a person is a smoker<br>

This project delves into how each factor relates to each other,<br>
and creates a multiple linear regression model to predict medical costs<br>

From this project, we can infer (may not apply to the real world) that the biggest contributing factors to <br>
a high medical cost is a high BMI score and being a smoker!<br>
